description: What I eat in a day

I eat exclusively meat.

## Why?

In early 2013 a reckless general medical practitioner prescribed me enough
antibiotics to [mess up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbiosis) my gut
microbiome. This lead to what was then a mild folliculitis to become severe
chronic folliculitis with chronic seborrhoeic dermatitis following suit.

I suffered with this condition for over 4 years, and saw plethora of
dermatologists \(who knew naught but to prescribe ever more antibiotics\). Then,
just within two weeks of going on the carnivore diet \(beef, salt and pepper\) I
was cured 95%.

## Is it safe?

The carnivore diet provides all the nutrients and is \(anecdotally\) safe to do
long-term. In fact, meat is the [only nutritionally complete
food](http://www.diagnosisdiet.com/food/meats/).

One ought to pay lip service to general nutritional wisdom as they are laced
with an anti-meat bias \(see below\) using [problematic epidemiological
studies](https://www.diagnosisdiet.com/epidemilogical-studies/) where, depending
on the researcher's nutritional bias, one can establish [_any_ food item to be
problematic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/buuzw5/is_everything_we_eat_associated_with_cancer_a/).
For a telling instance of how biased our health organizations can be, refer to
Dr. David M Klurfeld's
[report](https://peakhuman.libsyn.com/dr-david-klurfeld-on-meat-not-causing-cancer-bogus-vegetarian-scientists-and-balanced-nutrition)
of his experience with a WHO working group:

* \[Dr. David M Klurfeld\] was on the World Health Organization working group to decide if meat causes cancer in 2015 with a bunch of vegetarians and vegans and says it was the most frustrating professional experience of his life
* There were 22 scientists - half of which were epidemiologists
* They claimed they used 800 studies but they actually only used 18
* There was a group of people that were strongly against the vote
* He thinks a number of the people made up their minds before they even arrived

## Paleolithic Ketogenic diet

I'm interested in slowly transitioning to

... notes on that will be made here.
