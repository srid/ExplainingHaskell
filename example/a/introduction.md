description: What is, and *why* use, Rib?

Rib was designed to use *existing* tools instead of reinventing them while giving the
user full permission to compose them as they wish, instead of forcing any
particular framework.

Rib is best used with [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/); Nix makes it dead-easy
to create reproducible dev environments---a Haskell one in our case. The
included `ghcid` script uses Nix to install everything including GHC itself for
your Haskell program to build and run.
