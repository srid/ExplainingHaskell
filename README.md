Source code for my planned "Explaining Haskell" documentation project wherein I

2018.

## TODO

- [x] Think of first article to write
- [ ] DOING: Write it
- [ ] DOING: Develop backend & frontend to serve an article
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Share and get feedback on first article

- [ ] Upgrade mmark (thus megaparsec, etc.)

## Article Ideas

See articles/ for existing stubs. In addition, consider these ideas:
