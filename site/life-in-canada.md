description: What I think of living in Canada as an Indian-born immigrant
---

I have been living in Canada since 2008, and in Quebec since 2017. Two factors
primarily motivated me to immigrate here from Chennai: programming opportunities
\(more companies doing interesting stuff; conferences; people\) & liberal
culture \(eg.: no more arranged marriage\).

Although as new immigrant I started off rather naive--gullible to be precise--in
believing that I was automatically part of the new culture and therefore would
go through the self-same experiences, actual life experiences over the years
eventually twigged me into an intimate understanding of human groups &
belonging. It took some doing but eventually I have come to accept--even desire
to be in--the perpetual state of remaining a foreigner \(as Dariusz Galasi≈Ñski
[remarked](http://dariuszgalasinski.com/2016/10/06/i-am-and-i-will-always-be-a-foreigner/)
"_I refuse to give up being a foreigner_"\). I have virtually lost the desire to
make attempts to fit in.

What now appeal to me in regards to a place to live tend to be more practical
\(safety, pleasant weather, good standard of living, easy access to good quality
meat, etc.\) than social \(there is no expectation that people be certain way
other than follow the laws, social protocols and treat their fellow humans with
consideration\).

It is sensible to choose to maintain one's autonomy and a general sense of
well-being over working to satisfy some nebulous need to belong. And there are
much better things to do in life, like getting closer to [becoming
