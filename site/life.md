title: "Life"
description: A short summary of the recent years
---

I immigrated to Western Canada in 2008 (and then to Quebec in 2017) because I
preferred living in a liberal culture (eg: no more [arranged
marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage_in_the_Indian_subcontinent))
and being surrounded by more interesting tech culture.

Newness and gullibility were normal themes as a new immigrant; belief in the
veneer of equality was prevalent. Actual life experiences over the years
indicated otherwise, which twigged me to gain more understanding of the
universal nature of human groups and belonging.

Like [Dariusz
Galasinski](http://dariuszgalasinski.com/2016/10/06/i-am-and-i-will-always-be-a-foreigner/)
however I now prefer the perpetual state of remaining a foreigner, which
presents a freedom to not have to force oneself to fit in with some group.

I appreciate living in a safe place, with liberal attitudes, and good standard of
living with pleasant weather. As long as people follow the laws, social
protocols and treat their fellow humans with consideration not having to expect
anything socially is greatly liberating.

Becoming free of the need to belong means that I am getting closer to [becoming
free](http://actualfreedom.com.au/) of the human condition!
